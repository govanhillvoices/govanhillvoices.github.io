# Govanhill Voices

A welcoming and inclusive community choir for all abilities

## Come and sing with us! 

We meet every **Thursday.** Doors open **7.00pm** for a prompt start at 7.15pm, in **Queen’s Park Govanhill Church**, 170 Queen’s Dr, Glasgow G42 8QZ (‘The Yellow Door Church’) We are not, however, connected to the church and welcome those of all faiths and none.

A session lasts about 2 hours with a break in the middle for tea, biscuits and chat.

* We welcome singers of all backgrounds and abilities

* No auditions, no pressure to perform

* We learn songs by ear - no need to read music!

## A welcome for everybody

A core value of Govanhill Voices is and always will be **accessibility** to all. This means we take all levels of musical ability, from professional songpeople to those of us that might not hit every note every time.

It also means we are a donations based choir. You do not have to pay a fee to come along. Give as you feel or as you are able. We value you and your voice more than anything.

All are welcome in our choir, in terms of ethnicity, gender, sexuality, disability and faith.

Feel free to **contact us**: [govanhillvoices@gmail.com](mailto:govanhillvoices@gmail.com) or follow us on social media.
